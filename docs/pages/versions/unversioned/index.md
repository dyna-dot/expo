[Expo](http://expo.io) is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It consists of a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms, and these tools come together to help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

- ‚úÖ Access to device capabilities like camera, location, notifications, sensors, haptics, and much more, all with cross-platform APIs.
- ‚úÖ Build service gives you app-store ready binaries and handles certificates, no need for you to touch Xcode or Android Studio.
- ‚úÖ Notification service lets you send push notifications with close to zero setup required.
- ‚úÖ Over-the-air updates let you update your app at any time without the hassle and delays of submitting to the store.

## Learning Expo

The sections in this introduction will give you a theoretical foundation by explaining in more detail what Expo is and helping you build a mental model for how to think about app development the Expo way. They will also equip you with the knowledge you need to know which pieces of Expo are a good fit for your specific needs, if any.

- ‚û°Ô∏è **If this sounds like the kind of background information you'd like to know,** then [continue to the "Workflows" page](introduction/managed-vs-bare/) to learn about the two approaches to building applications with Expo.
- ‚§µÔ∏è **If you are more of a hands-on practical learner**  then you might want to go ahead and jump right into the ["Installation" guide](get-started/installation/) and come back here later. It's not necessary to read the entire introduction first.
