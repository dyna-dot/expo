[Expo](http://expo.io) is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It consists of a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms, and these tools come together to help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

The sections in this introduction will explain in more detail what Expo is and help you build a mental model for how to think about app development the Expo way. They will also equip you with the knowledge you need to know which pieces of Expo are a good fit for your specific needs, if any.

- ‚û°Ô∏è **If this sounds like the kind of background information you'd like to know,** then [continue to the "Workflows" page](introduction/managed-vs-bare/) to learn about the two approaches to building applications with Expo.
- ‚§µÔ∏è **Want to skip ahead to writing code?**  Go ahead and jump right into the ["Installation" guide](introduction/installation/) and come back here later. It's not necessary to read the entire introduction first.
- üì∫üëá**Want to see a preview of what this looks like before moving on?**  Take a look at the video below to see a "Hello World" application.
